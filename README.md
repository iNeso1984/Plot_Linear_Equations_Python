# Line Graph Generator

## Overview

The Line Graph Generator is a Streamlit application that allows users to visualize two linear equations in either standard or slope-intercept form. Users can input coefficients for each equation and generate a plot to see their intersection and behavior over a specified range.

## Features

- **User Input**: Easily enter coefficients for two linear equations in different forms.
- **Dynamic Plotting**: Generates a real-time plot of the input equations using Matplotlib.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a smooth user experience.

## Requirements

To run this application, you'll need the following packages:

- `streamlit`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `sympy`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit matplotlib numpy sympy
